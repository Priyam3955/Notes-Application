# Project Daily Goals Project
To chnge fonts go to google fonts and import the url of font from there.
Padding : To hav space in the ip box
Margin : to hv space at border of box from the screen.
We will now append the tasks in the container, Make task component.
Any task is to be added in tasks array.
This is easy to make this in react as compared to Javascript.
e.preventDefault is added and our work is done without reloading the page.
**console.log(....tasks)** -> Spread operator gets all the tasks value not the array.
in case of react we use useeffect and deletion of task is managed automatically.

The tasks are added in localstorage and can be accesses anytime if not deleted manually.



# To Debug the css 
Give border to * selector & check the error.

# React Routing
Page gets render when you link some webpage and page get render to another page from the original page.
Page will not reload but page will gets changed is called routing.
We need to install react-router-dom package.
